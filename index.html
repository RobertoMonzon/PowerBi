        <h2>Interactive Dashboard on Gastrointestinal Issues (2023)</h2>
        <p>I'm excited to share with you an exciting project I've been working on: an interactive dashboard on gastrointestinal issues in the year 2023. In this video, you'll get to see my work in action, which includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An interactive visualization that simulates the gastrointestinal system, providing a dynamic representation of the data.</li>
            <li>Detailed charts showing the distribution of my branches, patients by age, diagnoses, as well as analysis of cases per month and by gender.</li>
            <li>I used Power BI to create this tool, making the most of its capabilities for effective data visualization and analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm thrilled to share this project with the Power BI community and hope you find the ideas and approaches I've implemented helpful. I'd love to hear your feedback and discuss how we can continue to improve together in the field of data visualization and analysis in Power BI!</p>

        <h2>Interactive 3D Dental Dashboard</h2>
        <p>I have developed an interactive 3D dental dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of various dental metrics and statistics. This tool allows users to explore individual teeth in detail and access data on the number of patients treated for specific dental issues related to each tooth. Additionally, the dashboard includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A feature to track how many patients each of my dentists has attended.</li>
            <li>A line chart to calculate monthly revenue.</li>
            <li>A line chart to monitor the number of patients per month.</li>
            <li>A pie chart to display the gender distribution of patients.</li>
            <li>Four summary cards with key information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These features make the dashboard a valuable resource for dental professionals to analyze and track patient care and business performance efficiently.</p>
